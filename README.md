# Image Quality Evaluation Project

## Introduction
Good morning! I'm [Your Name], and this README will guide you through our Image Quality Evaluation project. In the next few minutes, we'll walk you through our project phases and highlight critical aspects of the results we've achieved.

## Topics to be Covered
In this README, we'll cover:

- Introduction of Image Quality Evaluation
- Project Overview
- Results and Comments

## Image Quality Evaluation Explained
- **Definition:** Image quality evaluation is a systematic process where we meticulously examine the visual aspects of an image to determine its quality.
- **Purpose:** The primary goal is to objectively measure and analyze image quality, ensuring visual content meets defined standards. This process aids decision-making in photography, design, and computer vision, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Project Phases
Our project involved an Image Quality Evaluation session, where group members collected and presented images for individual scoring (1 to 5) based on perceived beauty. Key phases included:

## Project Execution
1. Selection of grayscale images with a resolution of 512x512 in JPG format.
2. Each group member found and compressed their chosen image using Matlab.
3. Images were stored in a Drive folder.
4. Matlab code was created to randomize image display for evaluation.
5. Excel sheets were used for data collection.
6. Histograms were generated with Matlab for result evaluation.
7. Group evaluation and discussion of results.

## Results Analysis
- General histogram displaying average scores for each image and category.
- Specific examples with image scores and comments.

### Example Commentaries:
- Equal scores for the original and medium-compressed photograph.
- Surprisingly low scores for both the original and medium compression.
- Low scores for both medium and low compression.
- Consistent scores reflecting image quality and compression.

### Variance Comment:
- A lower variance, as seen in 'low compression,' indicates results closer to the mean value.
